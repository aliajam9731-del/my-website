    <h1>A mind in motion. A mission in progress. I’m Ali.</h1>

    <h2>Let’s Walk This Journey Together</h2>

    <p>I’m Ali. I’m 24. Mostly, I’m just someone who’s curious about life—and stubborn enough to chase big dreams, even when I’m not sure how they’ll play out.</p>

    <p>This website isn’t about bragging. It’s just a small window into my world. A place for you and me to meet, and maybe start a real connection.</p>

    <p>Part of my story is spending years at Sharif University of Technology, the kind of place where getting in is hard—and getting out is even harder. That chapter shaped me a lot, but it’s not the whole story.</p>

    <p>The truth is, I’m still figuring things out. I have big goals, but also big questions. Like—what matters more? Helping end extreme poverty on Earth? Or helping push humanity beyond Earth?</p>

    <p>Maybe I don’t have to choose. Maybe real growth—the kind I admire the most—is about both:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Feeding the hungry and reaching for the stars.</li>
        <li>Building clean water systems and building rocket ships.</li>
        <li>Teaching kids to read and figuring out how to raise my future daughter… maybe on the Moon.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I believe in progress. I believe in freedom. And I believe the fact that we went from cave fires to AI is something worth celebrating—even if sometimes, we still act like we’re stuck in the cave.</p>

    <p>So yeah, this site is my way of saying: Here’s where I’m at. Here’s what I’m thinking about. Let’s grow, explore, and figure it out—together.</p>

    <h2>About Me (Let’s Walk This Journey Together)</h2>

    <p>Who am I?</p>

    <p>Why did I build this site? (To build real connections)</p>

    <p>My values: Freedom, growth, learning, experiencing, impact</p>

    <h2>Mission & Dreams</h2>

    <p>Right now, these goals feel the most real and important to me. But I know that as I grow, my dreams might shift — new missions might appear, or these might deepen in ways I can’t yet see.</p>

    <p>Here’s what I’m chasing today:</p>

    <h3>Building wealth and freedom</h3>

    <p>I want to become a millionaire — not just for the money itself, but for the freedom and power it brings. Freedom to make choices, to create, and to live life on my terms. Having my own business is a big part of this — a place where I can build, experiment, and grow.</p>

    <h3>A personal project: seeing the world</h3>

    <p>Traveling is more than just a trip — it’s about truly understanding this planet and its people. This journey helps me learn and grow beyond books and screens.</p>

    <h3>Lifting one million people out of extreme poverty</h3>

    <p>One of my biggest dreams is to help at least one million people living on less than two dollars a day escape poverty — vaccinated, educated, well-fed, and with dignity — all before I turn 40.</p>

    <h3>Studying at Harvard</h3>

    <p>One day, I want to study at Harvard and talk with some of the brightest minds on the planet. I want to learn how we can work together to make the world a better place — not just dream about it, but actually do it.</p>

    <h3>Welcoming my daughter on the Moon</h3>

    <p>The wildest dream: to be part of humanity’s next giant leap. I want my daughter to be born on the Moon — a symbol of hope, progress, and the future we’re building beyond Earth.</p>

    <p>This is my mission today. If you’re here, it means you’re walking this path with me — wherever it leads.</p>

    <h2>Always a Student</h2>

    <p>Continuous learning. From Sharif to learning in life. Everything I learn, I log here.</p>

    <p>For me, learning isn’t just something you do in school—it’s life itself. I’m obsessed with growing, questioning, and figuring things out.</p>

    <p>Learning is how I stay alive—not just physically, but mentally, emotionally, and even spiritually.</p>

    <p>I studied mechanical engineering at Sharif University of Technology, which is known as the toughest and most competitive university in Iran. Getting in was hard. Getting out was harder. But learning never stopped there. It won’t stop anywhere.</p>

    <p>I read books. I listen to people smarter than me. I test ideas in real life—sometimes they work, sometimes they crash. Both teach me something.</p>

    <p>Right now, my learning path is a mix of business, technology, psychology, social impact, and life itself. Sometimes I study markets. Sometimes I study poverty. Sometimes I study myself.</p>

    <p>If you ever find me standing still, something’s wrong. Growth is the point. And I don’t plan on stopping.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>I love lists. They show me how far I’ve come—and how much is still ahead.</p>

    <p>Here’s what you’ll find in this section:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Books I’ve Read</li>
        <li>Movies and Series That Stayed With Me</li>
        <li>Games I’ve Finished (I’m not really a gamer—but I do love a good story and I’m great at finishing what I start.)</li>
        <li>Music I’ve Lived With</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It’s not about collecting titles. It’s about tracking the journey.</p>

    <h2>The Lab of Life</h2>

    <p>"I don’t wait for perfect plans—I test and learn."</p>

    <p>Career path? I test it. Business idea? I test it. Trip to a strange place? I test it.</p>

    <p>This is the space for my life laboratory. I put projects, ideas, and tests I've done or am doing here. (Whether successful or failed—both are important)</p>

    <p>This part of my life is all about testing and learning. I don’t believe in waiting for the perfect plan—I believe in trying things out, seeing what works, and learning from what doesn’t.</p>

    <p>In The Lab of Life, I run experiments. Sometimes it’s a YouTube idea. Sometimes it’s a business project. Sometimes it’s a sociology concept I’ve read about and want to explore. Sometimes it’s testing a new career path to see if it feels right for me.</p>

    <p>It’s basically my personal Test & Learn system. A place where I build real experiences—not just thoughts in my head.</p>

    <p>And here’s the deal: I’m not keeping these experiments to myself. I’m sharing them with you—failures, wins, lessons, and everything in between.</p>

    <h2>Notes from Me</h2>

    <p>Free thoughts and writings. Ideas, questions, mental models. My view of the world; if the world gets better, what should it look like to me?</p>

    <p>I love reading—but honestly, I love writing just as much. Over the years, I’ve built my own mental models about how the world works… or how I wish it worked.</p>

    <p>Maybe it’s because I studied engineering, maybe it’s just how my brain is wired—but I have this weird obsession with making things make sense. I like to break down ideas, organize thoughts, and create systems out of chaos. Especially in my head.</p>

    <p>Sometimes these thoughts turn into diagrams. Sometimes into math. (If you ever see me trying to model life with equations… don’t panic. I grew up with math. It’s a comfort thing.)</p>

    <p>To be honest, I don’t even think I’m a great engineer. But I do think I learned one valuable skill from that world: Thinking in structures. Building models. Asking: “How does this really work?”</p>

    <p>That’s what you’ll find here. Ideas, mental frameworks, and personal notes—my way of understanding life, one model at a time.</p>

    <h2>Say Hello</h2>

    <p>Have an idea? Want to share a thought? Or maybe you just feel like saying hi?</p>

    <p>This is the easiest way to reach me. No filters, no forms—just real connection.</p>

    <p>Drop me a message. I’ll read it. And if I can, I’ll reply. Let’s talk.</p>
